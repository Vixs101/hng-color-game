# Stage 1 - Frontend Intern Task: Color Game

## Task Requirements

### Languages
- HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript or React

## Game Requirements

### Color Display:
- Display a box with a randomly selected color; this will be the target color for the game.
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="colorBox"`

### Color Options:
- Display 6 color buttons, each representing a potential guess for the target color.
- Each button should have a background color corresponding to a possible guess.
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="colorOption"`

### Game Instructions:
- Display a message explaining the goal of the game (e.g., "Guess the correct color!").
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="gameInstructions"`

### Game Status:
- After each guess, display whether the guess is correct or wrong.
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="gameStatus"`

### Score:
- Display a score counter that increments for each correct guess.
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="score"`

### New Game Button:
- Include a button to reset the game and start a new round.
- **Attribute:** `data-testid="newGameButton"`

## Styling and Design
- The game should have an engaging and user-friendly interface.
- Buttons should be large and easy to click.
- Use contrasting colors to differentiate between the target color and the options.
- Use CSS for animations when showing game results (e.g., fade-out effect for wrong answers or celebration for correct ones).
- The design must be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Functionality
- Randomly select a color from a predefined set and display it as the target color.
- Implement the functionality for the player to click on the color buttons and check if they guessed correctly.
- Dynamically update the score and display messages based on the player’s guesses.
- Ensure that the new game button correctly resets the game to its initial state.

## Implementation Details
- The player will not see a hex code; they will only see the color itself.
- The six color options will also have background colors, and the player must select the one that matches the `colorBox`.
